Z-buffer Algorithm

- Algorithm used for Visible Surface Determination in Computer Graphics
- Stores the depth (z-coordinate) of each pixel
- Uses a 2D array to store the depth of each pixel
- Compares each incoming pixel's depth to the stored depth in the z-buffer
- If incoming pixel's depth is less than stored depth, the pixel is visible and its color is stored in the frame buffer
- If incoming pixel's depth is greater than stored depth, the pixel is not visible and discarded
