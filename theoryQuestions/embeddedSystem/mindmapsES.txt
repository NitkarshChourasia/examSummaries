  -Define test data
  -Define test procedure
  -Define test results
-Test Execution:
  -Verify memory components
  -Check memory type
  -Test memory integrity
  -Check memory accessibility
  -Test memory transfer rate
  -Verify memory write/read
  -Test memory refresh rate
  -Test memory cycle time
  -Check memory refresh mechanism
-Order:
  -Verify memory components 
  -Check memory type

- Timer that monitors the functioning of computer for proper operation
- Used to reset the system if it fails to function properly
- Monitors the normal flow of operations
- If the system fails to reset itself, the timer will reset it
- Can be used to recover from software errors, hardware errors or power failure
- Consists of a timer, a register and a reset circuit
- The register is loaded with a predefined value from which the timer counts down
- When the timer reaches zero, it triggers the reset circuit to reset the system

  -Hardware Maintenance

Phase 1: Requirements  
This phase is used to identify customer needs and define system constraints. In this stage, the customer requirements are collected, understood, and analyzed. The system constraints are defined which includes the hardware and software parameters. This phase involves the analysis of the customer’s needs, the environment, and the system requirements. This phase is important as it helps to define the scope of the project.

Phase 2: Design 
This phase is used to create the system architecture and detailed design. The system architecture is created based on the customer requirements and system constraints. The detailed design includes the design of the software components, hardware components, and interfaces. In this phase, the algorithms and data structures are also designed. The design documents are then created and reviewed by the stakeholders.
