[2023-02-22 18:49:15]: Create a short mindmap for the following question: In the context of Distributed Software Engineering, Your customer wants to develop a system for stock information where dealers can access information about companies and evaluate various investment scenarios using a simulation system. Each dealer uses this simulation in a different way, according to his or her experience and the type of stocks in question. Suggest client–server architecture for this system that shows where functionality is located. Justify the client–server system model that you have chosen.

[2023-02-22 18:49:24] RESPONSE: 
Client-Server Architecture: 
• Client: 
  - Dealer Interface 
  - Ability to access information about companies 
  - Ability to evaluate various investment scenarios using a simulation system
• Server: 
  - Database of stock information 
  - Simulation System 
Justification: 
The client-server architecture is beneficial for distributed software engineering because it allows for scalability and performance. The client side would be responsible for providing the dealers with an interface to access the stock information and the simulation system. The server side would be responsible for storing the stock information and providing the simulation system for the dealers to use. This setup allows for a more efficient system as the server side can be updated and maintained independently, while the client side can remain largely unchanged.
