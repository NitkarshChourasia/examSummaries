[2023-02-21 09:44:45] RESPONSE: 
System Models - Three System Organization Styles of Architectural Design

- System of Systems:
A system of systems is an architecture composed of several individual systems that are connected and interact to form a single, larger system. It generally consists of a set of subsystems that interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal.

- Layered Architectures:
Layered architectures are composed of several layers, each of which performs a specific function. These layers are organized in a hierarchy, with each layer depending on the one below it. This kind of architecture is used to achieve increased modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

- Microservices:
Microservices architectures involve the decomposition of an application into small, independent services that are built and deployed independently. Each service is responsible for a single task and communicates with other services through an API. This type of architecture is used to increase scalability and resilience.

[2023-02-21 10:01:43] RESPONSE: 
Fat-Client vs. Thin-Client

-Fat-Client:
  -Runs a full application locally on the client side
  -Requires more resources
  -Can operate without a network connection
  -Can process and store data
  -More control over user interface

-Thin-Client:
  -Runs a basic application on the client side
  -Requires less resources
  -Requires a network connection
  -Cannot process or store data
  -Less control over user interface

[2023-02-21 10:06:14]: Create a mindmap for the following question: In the context of Distributed Software Engineering, Your customer wants to develop a system for stock information where dealers can access information about companies and evaluate various investment scenarios using a simulation system. Each dealer uses this simulation in a different way, according to his or her experience and the type of stocks in question. Suggest client–server architecture for this system that shows where functionality is located. Justify the client–server system model that you have chosen.

[2023-02-21 10:06:22] RESPONSE: 
Client – Server Architecture for Stock Information System

Client: 
• Dealers access information about companies 
• Dealers evaluate various investment scenarios using a simulation system 
• Different ways of simulation usage according to experience and type of stocks 

Server: 
• Store stock information 
• Provide simulation system 
• Generate reports 

Justification: 
• Client-server architecture is best suited for the given scenario as it allows dealers to access the information and use the simulation system remotely, while the server hosts and stores the data and provides the simulation system. 
• Client-server architecture also offers better scalability, reliability, and security. It also allows for easy maintenance and upgrade of the system.
