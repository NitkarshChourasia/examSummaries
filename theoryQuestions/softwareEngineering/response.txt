ISO 9000 is a family of international standards for quality management and assurance. It is designed to help organizations ensure that they meet the needs of customers and other stakeholders while meeting statutory and regulatory requirements related to a product or service. The standards are based on a number of quality management principles including a strong customer focus, the motivation and implication of top management, the process approach and continual improvement. Organizations that meet the standards are certified by an external body, such as an accreditation body, and are then able to display the ISO 9000 certification mark. The ISO 9000 standards are used by organizations worldwide to demonstrate their commitment to quality and customer satisfaction. They are also used as a tool for process improvement, helping organizations identify areas for improvement and develop strategies for achieving them.

Question: 
In the context of Process Improvement, Explain process improvement cycle.
Solution:



The process improvement cycle is a continuous cycle of activities that organizations use to identify, analyze, and improve their processes. It is a systematic approach to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of processes. The cycle consists of four steps: Plan, Do, Check, and Act. 

Plan: The first step in the process improvement cycle is to plan the improvement. This involves identifying the process to be improved, gathering data about the current process, and setting goals for improvement. 

Do: The second step is to implement the improvement plan. This involves making changes to the process and testing them to ensure they are effective. 

Check: The third step is to check the results of the improvement plan. This involves measuring the performance of the process and comparing it to the goals set in the planning stage. 

Act: The fourth step is to act on the results of the check. This involves making changes to the process based on the results of the check and ensuring that these changes are implemented effectively.

Question: 
In the context of Service Oriented Software Enginering, What are the most important distinctions between services and software components?
Solution:



1. Services are typically designed to be consumed by external clients, while software components are designed to be used internally within an application.
2. Services are typically exposed through a public interface, while software components are usually hidden from external clients.
3. Services are typically stateless, while software components may maintain state information.
4. Services are typically designed to be loosely coupled, while software components are usually tightly coupled.
5. Services are typically designed to be interoperable, while software components may not be interoperable with other components or services.
6. Services are typically designed to be reusable, while software components may not be reusable in other applications.

Question: 
In the context of Service Oriented Software Enginering, Explain why SOAs should be based on standards.
Solution:



Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) should be based on standards for a number of reasons. Firstly, standards provide a common language for different systems to communicate with each other. This allows for interoperability between different systems, which is essential for SOAs. Secondly, standards provide a level of consistency and reliability that is necessary for SOAs to function properly. Thirdly, standards help to ensure that the services provided by the SOA are secure and reliable. Finally, standards help to reduce the cost of development and maintenance of the SOA, as they provide a common set of rules and guidelines that can be followed.

Question: 
In the context of Service Oriented Software Enginering, Giving reasons for your answer, suggest two important types of applications where you would not recommend the use of service-oriented architecture.
Solution:



1. Real-time applications: Service-oriented architecture is not suitable for real-time applications because it requires a certain amount of latency for the services to be invoked and the response to be returned. This latency can cause delays in the application, which is not acceptable in real-time applications.

2. Security-critical applications: Service-oriented architecture is not suitable for security-critical applications because it requires a certain level of trust between the services and the clients. This trust can be compromised if the services are not properly secured, which can lead to security breaches in the application.

Question: 
In the context of Service Oriented Software Enginering, Using BPMN, design a workflow that uses the catalog service to look up and place orders for computer equipment.
Solution:



![BPMN Workflow](./bpmn_workflow.png)

Question: 
In the context of Service Oriented Software Enginering, Explain what is meant by a ‘compensation action’ and, using an example, show why these actions may have to be included in workflows.
Solution:



A compensation action is a type of action that is used to undo the effects of a previous action in a workflow. This is necessary when an error occurs in the workflow, or when the workflow needs to be rolled back to a previous state.

For example, consider a workflow that involves transferring money from one bank account to another. If an error occurs during the transfer, the compensation action would be to reverse the transfer and return the money to its original account. This ensures that the money is not lost and that the accounts remain in balance.

Question: 
In the context of Service Oriented Software Enginering, For the example of the vacation package reservation service, design a workflow that will book ground transportation for a group of passengers arriving at an airport. They should be given the option of booking either a taxi or renting a car. You may assume that the taxi and car rental companies offer web services to make a reservation.
Solution:



1. The vacation package reservation service receives a request from a group of passengers to book ground transportation.
2. The service checks the availability of taxis and car rentals at the airport.
3. The service presents the passengers with the available options for ground transportation (taxi or car rental).
4. The passengers select their preferred option (taxi or car rental).
5. The service contacts the taxi or car rental company's web service to make the reservation.
6. The service confirms the reservation with the passengers and provides them with any necessary information (e.g. pick-up time, contact information, etc.).
7. The service sends a confirmation of the reservation to the taxi or car rental company's web service.
8. The service updates its records to reflect the new reservation.

Question: 
In the context of Service Oriented Software Enginering, Using an example, explain in detail why the thorough testing of services that include compensation actions is difficult.
Solution:



Testing services that include compensation actions is difficult because it requires a thorough understanding of the entire system and its components. Compensation actions are designed to ensure that the system remains in a consistent state even if an error occurs. This means that the system must be tested to ensure that the compensation actions are triggered correctly and that the system is able to recover from any errors.

For example, consider a banking system that includes a service for transferring money between accounts. This service includes a compensation action that reverses the transfer if an error occurs. To thoroughly test this service, the tester must understand how the transfer works, how the compensation action works, and how the system recovers from any errors. This requires a deep understanding of the entire system and its components, which can be difficult to achieve.

In addition, testing services with compensation actions can be difficult because it requires testing multiple scenarios. For example, in the banking system example, the tester must test not only the successful transfer of money between accounts, but also scenarios where errors occur and the compensation action is triggered. This requires a lot of time and effort to ensure that all scenarios are tested thoroughly.

Overall, testing services with compensation actions is difficult because it requires a thorough understanding of the entire system and its components, as well as testing multiple scenarios. This can be time consuming and require a lot of effort to ensure that all scenarios are tested thoroughly.

Question: In the context of Software Reuse, What are the major technical and nontechnical factors that hinder software reuse? Do you personally reuse much software and, if not, why not?
Solution:



The major technical factors that hinder software reuse include:

1. Lack of compatibility between existing software and the new software.
2. Difficulty in understanding the existing code and its structure.
3. Difficulty in adapting the existing code to the new requirements.
4. Difficulty in maintaining the existing code.
5. Difficulty in debugging and testing the existing code.

The major non-technical factors that hinder software reuse include:

1. Lack of awareness of the benefits of software reuse.
2. Lack of incentives for developers to reuse existing code.
3. Lack of standardization and documentation of existing code.
4. Lack of a centralized repository for existing code.
5. Lack of a culture of collaboration and sharing among developers.

I personally do not reuse much software, mainly because I prefer to write my own code from scratch, as I find it more satisfying and enjoyable to do so.

Question: 
In the context of Software Reuse, Suggest why the savings in cost from reusing existing software are not simply proportional to the size of the components that are reused.
Solution:



The savings in cost from reusing existing software are not simply proportional to the size of the components that are reused because there are other factors that need to be taken into account. For example, the cost of integrating the reused components into the new system, the cost of maintaining and updating the reused components, and the cost of training personnel to use the reused components. Additionally, there may be hidden costs associated with reusing existing software, such as compatibility issues or security risks.

Question: 
In the context of Software Reuse, Give four circumstances where you might recommend against software reuse.
Solution:



1. When the existing software is outdated or no longer supported.
2. When the existing software does not meet the current requirements or specifications.
3. When the existing software is not compatible with the current hardware or operating system.
4. When the existing software has security vulnerabilities or other known issues that cannot be addressed.

Question: 
In the context of Software Reuse, Explain what is meant by ‘inversion of control’ in application frameworks. Explain why this approach could cause problems if you integrated two separate systems that were originally created using the same application framework.
Solution:



Inversion of control (IoC) is a design pattern used in application frameworks that allows for the decoupling of components from each other. It is based on the principle of “inverting” the control flow of an application, so that instead of the application code controlling the flow of execution, the framework controls it. This allows for greater flexibility and reusability of code, as components can be easily swapped out and replaced with different implementations.

However, this approach can cause problems when integrating two separate systems that were originally created using the same application framework. This is because the two systems may have different implementations of components, which could lead to incompatibilities between them. Additionally, if the two systems were developed at different times, they may have different versions of the same components, which could also lead to incompatibilities.

Question: 
In the context of Software Reuse, Most desktop software, such as word processing software, can be configured in a number of different ways. Examine software that you regularly use and list the configuration options for that software. Suggest difficulties that users might have in configuring the software. If you use Microsoft Office or Open Office, these are good examples to use for this exercise.
Solution:



Microsoft Office:

Configuration Options: 
1. Language: Users can choose the language they want to use for the software.
2. Theme: Users can choose from a variety of themes to customize the look and feel of the software.
3. Fonts: Users can choose from a variety of fonts to customize the look and feel of the software.
4. File Format: Users can choose which file format they want to save their documents in.
5. AutoCorrect: Users can enable or disable auto-correct features for spelling and grammar.
6. AutoFormat: Users can enable or disable auto-formatting features for text and tables.
7. Security Settings: Users can configure security settings to protect their documents from unauthorized access.

Difficulties that users might have in configuring the software: 
1. Understanding the different configuration options and how they affect the software’s performance. 
2. Knowing which settings are best for their particular needs and preferences. 
3. Keeping track of all the different settings and making sure they are all set correctly. 
4. Making sure that all settings are compatible with other software they may be using in conjunction with Microsoft Office.

Question: 
In the context of Software Reuse, Why have many large companies chosen ERP systems as the basis for their organizational information system? What problems may arise when deploying a large-scale ERP system in an organization?
Solution:



Many large companies have chosen ERP systems as the basis for their organizational information system because of the cost savings associated with software reuse. ERP systems provide a comprehensive suite of integrated applications that can be used to manage a company’s core business processes, such as accounting, inventory management, customer relationship management, and human resources. ERP systems also provide a platform for integrating data from multiple sources, allowing companies to gain greater visibility into their operations.

However, deploying a large-scale ERP system in an organization can be a complex and costly endeavor. Companies must invest in hardware and software infrastructure, as well as training and support personnel. Additionally, the implementation process can be lengthy and disruptive to existing operations. Companies must also ensure that their ERP system is properly configured to meet their specific needs and that it is kept up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates. Finally, companies must ensure that their data is properly backed up and secured to protect against data loss or theft.

Question: 
In the context of Software Reuse, Identify six possible risks that can arise when systems are constructed using COTS. What steps can a company take to reduce these risks?
Solution:



1. Security Risks: COTS systems may contain security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors. Companies can reduce this risk by performing regular security audits and patching any identified vulnerabilities.

2. Compatibility Issues: COTS systems may not be compatible with existing systems or infrastructure, leading to integration issues. Companies can reduce this risk by thoroughly testing the COTS system before implementation and ensuring that it is compatible with existing systems.

3. Vendor Lock-in: Companies may become dependent on a single vendor for their COTS system, leading to a lack of flexibility and increased costs. Companies can reduce this risk by researching multiple vendors and selecting one that offers the best value for money.

4. Cost Overruns: COTS systems may require additional customization or integration work, leading to unexpected costs. Companies can reduce this risk by thoroughly researching the COTS system before purchase and budgeting for any additional costs.

5. Maintenance Issues: COTS systems may require regular maintenance and updates, leading to increased costs and downtime. Companies can reduce this risk by selecting a vendor that offers reliable maintenance and support services.

6. Licensing Issues: Companies may not be aware of the licensing terms associated with the COTS system, leading to legal issues or unexpected costs. Companies can reduce this risk by thoroughly researching the licensing terms before purchase and ensuring that they are compliant with all applicable laws and regulations.

Question: 
In the context of Software Reuse, Explain why adaptors are usually needed when systems are constructed by integrating COTS products. Suggest three practical problems that might arise in writing adaptor software to link two COTS application products.
Solution:



Adaptors are usually needed when systems are constructed by integrating COTS products because they provide a bridge between two different systems, allowing them to communicate and exchange data. Adaptors are necessary to ensure that the two systems can interact with each other in a meaningful way.

Three practical problems that might arise in writing adaptor software to link two COTS application products include: 

1. Ensuring compatibility between the two systems: Adaptors must be written to ensure that the two systems are compatible and can exchange data without any errors.

2. Maintaining data integrity: Adaptors must be written to ensure that data is not corrupted or lost during the exchange process.

3. Ensuring security: Adaptors must be written to ensure that data is secure and not accessible by unauthorized users.

Question: 
In the context of Software Reuse, The reuse of software raises a number of copyright and intellectual property issues. If a customer pays a software contractor to develop a system, who has the right to reuse the developed code? Does the software contractor have the right to use that code as a basis for a generic component? What payment mechanisms might be used to reimburse providers of reusable components? Discuss these issues and other ethical issues associated with the reuse of software.
Solution:



Copyright and intellectual property issues are a major concern when it comes to software reuse. When a customer pays a software contractor to develop a system, the customer typically owns the copyright to the code. This means that the software contractor does not have the right to use that code as a basis for a generic component without the customer’s permission.

In order to ensure that the software contractor is properly compensated for their work, payment mechanisms such as royalties or licensing fees should be used. These payment mechanisms should be agreed upon by both parties before any work is done.

In addition to copyright and intellectual property issues, there are also ethical issues associated with software reuse. For example, it is important to ensure that any reused code is properly attributed and credited to its original author. It is also important to ensure that any reused code is not used in a way that violates any applicable laws or regulations. Finally, it is important to ensure that any reused code does not contain any malicious code or security vulnerabilities.

Question: 

In the context of Distributed Software Engineering, What do you understand by ‘scalability ’? Discuss the differences between ‘scaling up’ and ‘scaling out’ and explain when these different approaches to scalability may be used.
Solution:



Scalability is the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of work or load in a graceful manner. It is an important factor to consider when designing distributed software systems, as it allows the system to grow and adapt to changing demands.

Scaling up refers to increasing the capacity of a single system by adding more resources such as memory, storage, or processing power. This approach is often used when the system needs to handle more data or transactions, but the existing hardware can be upgraded to meet the demand.

Scaling out, on the other hand, involves adding additional systems to the existing infrastructure. This approach is often used when the existing system cannot be upgraded any further and additional capacity is needed. It also allows for better fault tolerance and redundancy, as each system can be used to handle different tasks.

Scaling up is usually used when there is a need for more processing power or storage capacity, while scaling out is used when there is a need for more systems to handle increased workloads. Both approaches can be used in distributed software engineering, depending on the specific requirements of the system.

Question: 
In the context of Distributed Software Engineering, Explain why distributed software systems are more complex than centralized software systems, where all of the system functionality is implemented on a single computer.
Solution:



Distributed software systems are more complex than centralized software systems because they involve multiple computers, networks, and other components that must be coordinated and managed. This complexity arises from the need to ensure that all components are working together in a reliable and secure manner. Additionally, distributed systems must be able to handle communication between different components, as well as manage data replication and synchronization. Furthermore, distributed systems must also be able to handle failure of individual components without compromising the overall system. All of these complexities add up to make distributed software systems more complex than centralized software systems.

Question: 
In the context of Distributed Software Engineering, Using an example of a remote procedure call, explain how middleware coordinates the interaction of computers in a distributed system.
Solution:



A remote procedure call (RPC) is a type of inter-process communication that allows a computer program to cause a subroutine or procedure to execute in another address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network) without the programmer explicitly coding the details for this remote interaction.

Middleware is software that acts as an intermediary between two applications, allowing them to communicate and exchange data. In the context of distributed software engineering, middleware coordinates the interaction of computers in a distributed system by providing a layer of abstraction between the applications and the underlying network. This layer of abstraction allows applications to communicate with each other without having to be aware of the underlying network protocols or hardware.

For example, when using an RPC, middleware can provide an interface that allows two applications to communicate without having to know the details of how the communication is actually taking place. The middleware will handle all of the details such as setting up the connection, sending and receiving data, and ensuring that the data is received correctly. This allows the applications to focus on their own tasks without having to worry about how they are communicating with each other.

Question: 
In the context of Distributed Software Engineering, What is the fundamental difference between a fat-client and a thin-client approach to client–server systems architectures?
Solution:



The fundamental difference between a fat-client and a thin-client approach to client–server systems architectures is the amount of processing power and data storage that is located on the client side. In a fat-client approach, the client is responsible for a large portion of the processing and data storage, while in a thin-client approach, the client is responsible for minimal processing and data storage. In a fat-client approach, the client is responsible for most of the application logic and data storage, while in a thin-client approach, the server is responsible for most of the application logic and data storage.

Question: 
In the context of Distributed Software Engineering, You have been asked to design a secure system that requires strong authentication and authorization. The system must be designed so that communications between parts of the system cannot be intercepted and read by an attacker. Suggest the most appropriate client–server architecture for this system and, giving reasons for your answer, propose how functionality should be distributed between the client and the server systems.
Solution:



The most appropriate client-server architecture for this system is a multi-tier architecture. This architecture allows for the separation of the client and server components, which is essential for secure communications. The client tier would be responsible for providing the user interface and handling user authentication. The server tier would be responsible for providing the application logic and authorization.

The client tier should be responsible for providing the user interface, handling user authentication, and encrypting data before sending it to the server. The server tier should be responsible for providing the application logic, authorization, and decrypting data received from the client. The server should also be responsible for generating and storing cryptographic keys used to encrypt and decrypt data.

By separating the client and server components, communications between them can be encrypted using a secure protocol such as TLS or SSH. This ensures that any data sent between the two components cannot be intercepted and read by an attacker. Additionally, by separating the authentication and authorization logic from the application logic, it is possible to ensure that only authorized users can access the system.

Question: 
In the context of Distributed Software Engineering, Your customer wants to develop a system for stock information where dealers can access information about companies and evaluate various investment scenarios using a simulation system. Each dealer uses this simulation in a different way, according to his or her experience and the type of stocks in question. Suggest client–server architecture for this system that shows where functionality is located. Justify the client–server system model that you have chosen.
Solution:



The client-server architecture for this system should be based on a three-tier model. The first tier would be the client tier, which would consist of the dealers' computers. This tier would be responsible for providing the user interface and allowing the dealers to interact with the system. The second tier would be the application server tier, which would host the simulation system and provide the necessary logic and calculations for the dealers to evaluate various investment scenarios. The third tier would be the database server tier, which would store all of the stock information and other data needed by the simulation system.

The client-server architecture is ideal for this system because it allows for scalability and flexibility. The client tier can easily be scaled up or down depending on the number of dealers using the system, while the application server tier can be scaled up or down depending on the complexity of the simulation system. Additionally, the database server tier can be scaled up or down depending on how much data needs to be stored. This allows for a more efficient use of resources and ensures that the system can handle any changes in demand or usage.

Question: 
In the context of Distributed Software Engineering, Using a distributed component approach, propose architecture for a national theater booking system. Users can check seat availability and book seats at a group of theaters. The system should support ticket returns so that people may return their tickets for last-minute resale to other customers.
Solution:



Architecture:

1. Client-Server Architecture: The client-server architecture will be used to provide a user interface for the theater booking system. The client will be responsible for providing the user interface and the server will be responsible for managing the data and processing requests from the client.

2. Database: A database will be used to store all the data related to the theater booking system, such as theater information, seat availability, ticket prices, etc. The database should be distributed across multiple servers in order to ensure scalability and reliability.

3. Web Services: Web services will be used to provide an interface between the client and the server. The web services will be responsible for handling requests from the client and sending responses back to the client.

4. Ticket Resale System: A ticket resale system will be used to allow customers to return their tickets for last-minute resale to other customers. This system should be integrated with the database so that it can access the necessary data in order to process requests from customers.

5. Security: Security measures should be implemented in order to protect the data stored in the database and ensure that only authorized users can access it. This can include authentication and authorization mechanisms, encryption, etc.

Question: 
In the context of Distributed Software Engineering, Give two advantages and two disadvantages of decentralized and semicentralized peer-to-peer architectures.
Solution:



Advantages of Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Architectures:
1. Increased scalability: Decentralized architectures are more scalable than centralized architectures because they do not rely on a single server or node to handle all requests. This allows for more users to be added without impacting performance.
2. Improved reliability: Decentralized architectures are more reliable than centralized architectures because they do not rely on a single point of failure. If one node fails, the system can still function as long as other nodes are available.

Disadvantages of Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Architectures:
1. Increased complexity: Decentralized architectures are more complex than centralized architectures because they require more nodes and communication protocols to be managed. This can lead to increased development and maintenance costs.
2. Reduced security: Decentralized architectures are less secure than centralized architectures because they do not have a single point of control. This makes it easier for malicious actors to gain access to the system and cause damage.

Advantages of Semicentralized Peer-to-Peer Architectures:
1. Improved scalability: Semicentralized architectures are more scalable than decentralized architectures because they rely on a central server or node to handle some requests, while still allowing for additional nodes to be added as needed.
2. Improved security: Semicentralized architectures are more secure than decentralized architectures because they have a single point of control that can be used to monitor and manage access to the system.

Disadvantages of Semicentralized Peer-to-Peer Architectures:
1. Reduced reliability: Semicentralized architectures are less reliable than decentralized architectures because they rely on a single server or node to handle some requests. If this node fails, the system may not be able to function properly.
2. Increased complexity: Semicentralized architectures are more complex than decentralized architectures because they require additional communication protocols and nodes to be managed. This can lead to increased development and maintenance costs.

Question: 
In the context of Distributed Software Engineering, Explain why deploying software as a service can reduce the IT support costs for a company. What additional costs might arise if this deployment model is used?
Solution:



Deploying software as a service can reduce IT support costs for a company because it eliminates the need for the company to maintain and manage its own hardware and software infrastructure. This reduces the need for IT personnel to manage and maintain the system, as well as the cost of purchasing and maintaining hardware and software. Additionally, deploying software as a service can reduce the cost of software upgrades, since the provider is responsible for keeping the software up to date.

However, deploying software as a service can also incur additional costs. These costs include subscription fees for the service, as well as any additional fees associated with customizing or integrating the software with other systems. Additionally, there may be additional costs associated with data storage and security, depending on the provider. Finally, there may be additional costs associated with training personnel to use the new system.

Question: 
In the context of Distributed Software Engineering, Your company wishes to move from using desktop applications to accessing the same functionality remotely as services. Identify three risks that might arise and suggest how these risks may be reduced.
Solution:



1. Security Risk: Moving to a remote service could increase the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data. To reduce this risk, the company should ensure that all data is encrypted and stored securely, and that access to the service is restricted to authorized users.

2. Performance Risk: Remote services may not be able to provide the same level of performance as desktop applications. To reduce this risk, the company should ensure that the service is properly tested and monitored for performance issues.

3. Reliability Risk: Remote services may be subject to outages or other reliability issues. To reduce this risk, the company should ensure that the service is properly monitored and maintained, and that there are redundancies in place in case of an outage.
