[2023-02-22 18:18:39] RESPONSE: 
System organization styles of architectural design:

• Hierarchical:
-A hierarchical system is one in which the components of a system are organized into levels or layers, with each layer controlling the one below it. The highest level is the most abstract and general, while the lowest level is the most concrete and specific.

• Modular:
-A modular system is one in which the components of a system are organized into self-contained, interchangeable units that can be connected together to form a larger system.

• Object-Oriented:
-An object-oriented system is one in which the components of the system are organized into objects, or self-contained units that encapsulate both data and the rules that govern how that data can be manipulated.

[2023-02-22 18:25:13] RESPONSE: 
Algorithmic Cost Modelling

- Definition:
    - Algorithmic cost modelling is a method of software cost estimation which uses mathematical algorithms to predict the cost of a software project.

- Advantages:
    - Accurate: Algorithmic cost models are more accurate than other methods of software cost estimation, as they are based on complex calculations and formulas.
    - Flexible: Algorithmic cost modelling is flexible, as it allows for changes to be made to the project scope, timeline, and other variables.

- Disadvantages:
    - Time Consuming: Algorithmic cost modelling can be time consuming, as the calculations involved can be complex and time consuming.
    - Limited Scope: Algorithmic cost modelling is limited in scope, as it is only able to predict the cost of a software project within certain parameters.

- Steps:
    - Define project parameters: First, the project parameters must be defined, such as the scope, timeline, budget, and other variables.
    - Determine cost factors: Next, the cost factors must be determined, such as the cost of labor, materials, overhead, etc.
    - Calculate costs: Finally, the costs must be calculated using the cost factors and project parameters.

- Examples:
    - COCOMO: The Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) is a widely used algorithmic cost model which is used to predict the cost of a software project.
    - Function Point Analysis (FPA): Function Point Analysis is another algorithmic cost model which is used to predict the cost of a software project.

[2023-02-22 18:28:52] RESPONSE: 
Compensation Action

• Definition: A mechanism used to help maintain the integrity of a transaction when an error occurs during the process.

• Characteristics:
Compensations are typically “undo” operations that reverse the effects of a previous action taken in the workflow.

• Example:
A user is booking an airline ticket and the system fails to properly execute the payment transaction. The compensation action would be to “undo” the booking, releasing the seat back into the system. This would ensure that the user’s money is not taken, and the airline is not left with an empty seat.

[2023-02-22 18:29:15] RESPONSE: 
Testing of Services with Compensation Actions Difficult

1. Context of Service Oriented Software Engineering
- Service-oriented software engineering
-- Focuses on the creation of interoperable services
-- Services are autonomous, self-contained, self-describing, and loosely coupled

2. Example
- Banking system
-- Transfer money from one account to another

3. Why Testing is Difficult
- Testing services is more complex than testing a single application
-- Services have dependencies on other services
-- Testing must be done from an end-to-end perspective
- Compensating actions are difficult to test
-- Compensating actions are corrective actions that are triggered when a service fails
-- Must test for all possible scenarios in order to ensure that the compensating action works
-- Requires a thorough understanding of the service and its operations
- Testing of services with compensation actions is even more difficult
-- Requires complex and sophisticated test scenarios 
-- Highly dependent on the quality of the code
-- Difficult to ensure that the compensating action works in all possible scenarios
-- Requires careful planning to design a comprehensive test strategy that covers all possible scenarios

[2023-02-22 18:31:34] RESPONSE: 
Remote Procedure Call

  - Definition:
    - A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a type of inter-process communication (IPC) which allows a computer program to cause a subroutine or procedure to execute in another address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network) without the programmer explicitly coding the details for this remote interaction.

  - Example:
    - Client-Server Model
      - Client:
        - Sends a request to the server
      - Server:
        - Receives request, calls the appropriate subroutine
        - Executes the requested procedure
        - Returns results to the client

Middleware
  - Definition:
    - Middleware is software that provides services to the applications in a distributed system in order to enable communication and data sharing between them.

  - Coordinating Interaction:
    - Translates requests: 
      - Middleware is responsible for translating requests that are issued by the client into a format compatible with the server.
    - Registers services:
      - Middleware keeps track of which services are available in the distributed system.
    - Manages communication:
      - Middleware manages the communication between client and server, ensuring that messages are delivered reliably, securely, and quickly.
    - Controls access:
      - Middleware controls access to the services, ensuring that only authorized users are able to access the system.
    - Ensures consistency:
      - Middleware ensures that data is consistent and up-to-date across the distributed system.
    - Monitors performance:
      - Middleware monitors the performance of the system, ensuring that it is operating optimally.

Client-Server Architecture for Stock Information System

• Client – Server System Model:
    ○ Advantages: 
        ▪ Data and resources are distributed across multiple servers and clients, which reduces the reliance on any single system.
        ▪ Allows for scalability and flexibility in design.
        ▪ Increased security due to the separation of resources and data.
        ▪ Improved performance due to the distributed nature of the architecture.
        ▪ Allows for more control over the system and its data.
    ○ Disadvantages:
        ▪ High cost associated with maintaining multiple systems.
        ▪ Difficult to maintain the network due to the complexity of the system.
        ▪ Vulnerabilities associated with the distributed nature of the architecture.
• Server:
    ○ Database: 
        ▪ Stores all of the information related to the stock information system.
    ○ Web Server:
        ▪ Responsible for hosting the web application that provides access to the system.
    ○ Application Server:
        ▪ Responsible for providing access to the simulation system, which allows dealers to evaluate various investment scenarios.
• Client:
    ○ Web Browser:
        ▪ Responsible for providing access to the web application hosted on the web server.
    ○ Simulation System:
        ▪ Provides dealers with the ability to evaluate various investment scenarios.
