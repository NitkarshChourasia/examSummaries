What is kurtosis? Explain different types of kurtosis

Kurtosis is a measure of the peakedness and thickness of the tails of a probability distribution compared to a normal distribution. A normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3, which is sometimes referred to as "mesokurtic." A distribution with a kurtosis greater than 3 is said to be "leptokurtic," which means it has a higher peak and fatter tails than the normal distribution. A distribution with a kurtosis less than 3 is said to be "platykurtic," which means it has a lower peak and thinner tails than the normal distribution.

There are three types of kurtosis:

    Leptokurtic: A distribution with a kurtosis greater than 3 is said to be leptokurtic. This means that the distribution has a higher peak and fatter tails than the normal distribution. Leptokurtic distributions are more peaked than the normal distribution, and have more data points closer to the mean. Examples of leptokurtic distributions include the t-distribution and the Laplace distribution.

    Mesokurtic: A distribution with a kurtosis of 3 is said to be mesokurtic. This means that the distribution has the same peakedness and thickness of tails as the normal distribution. The normal distribution is an example of a mesokurtic distribution.

    Platykurtic: A distribution with a kurtosis less than 3 is said to be platykurtic. This means that the distribution has a lower peak and thinner tails than the normal distribution. Platykurtic distributions are less peaked than the normal distribution, and have more data points farther from the mean. Examples of platykurtic distributions include the uniform distribution and the exponential distribution.
