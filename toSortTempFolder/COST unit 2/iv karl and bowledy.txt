To find Karl Pearson’s coefficient of Skewness and Bowley's coefficient of Skewness for the given data, we need to first find the measures of central tendency and dispersion.

Mean (𝑥̄) = (4+7+5+9+8+3+6)/7 = 6

Median = 6

Mode = No mode

Range = Max value – Min value = 9 – 3 = 6

Variance (𝑠^2) = Σ(𝑥−𝑥̄)^2/n = ((4-6)^2 + (7-6)^2 + (5-6)^2 + (9-6)^2 + (8-6)^2 + (3-6)^2 + (6-6)^2)/7 = 5.14

Standard deviation (𝑠) = √(𝑠^2) = √5.14 = 2.27

Now, using the formulas:

Karl Pearson’s coefficient of Skewness = (3 * (Mean – Median)) / Standard deviation

= (3 * (6 – 6)) / 2.27

= 0

Bowley's coefficient of Skewness = (Q3 + Q1 - 2 Median) / (Q3 - Q1)

where Q1 and Q3 are the first and third quartiles, respectively.

Q1 = 4.5 and Q3 = 8

Bowley's coefficient of Skewness = (8 + 4.5 - 2*6)/(8 - 4.5)

= -0.5

Therefore, the Karl Pearson’s coefficient of Skewness is 0 and the Bowley's coefficient of Skewness is -0.5 for the given data.

In context of Computer Oriented Statistical Techniques,
What is meant by these terms?
Mean, Median, Mode, Range, Standard Deviation, Mode of Distribution

In the context of Computer Oriented Statistical Techniques, the following terms can be defined as:

    Mean: It is the arithmetic average of a set of values, obtained by summing all the values and dividing the sum by the number of values.

    Median: It is the middle value of a set of values arranged in order of size.

    Mode: It is the value that appears most frequently in a set of values.

    Range: It is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a set of values.

    Standard Deviation: It is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values, obtained by calculating the square root of the variance.

    Mode of Distribution: It is the value or values of a random variable that occur most frequently in a data set or probability distribution.

These terms are commonly used in statistical analysis to describe and interpret data sets.
