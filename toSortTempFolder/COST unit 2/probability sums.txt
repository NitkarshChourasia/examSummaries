In context of Computer Oriented Statistical Techniques,
A ball is drawn at random from a box containing 6 red balls, 4 white balls, and 5 blue balls.
Determine the probability that the ball drawn is a) red b) white c) blue d) not red e) red or white.

a) Probability of drawing a red ball = (Number of red balls) / (Total number of balls) = 6 / (6+4+5) = 6/15 = 2/5

b) Probability of drawing a white ball = (Number of white balls) / (Total number of balls) = 4 / (6+4+5) = 4/15

c) Probability of drawing a blue ball = (Number of blue balls) / (Total number of balls) = 5 / (6+4+5) = 5/15 = 1/3

d) Probability of drawing a not red ball = 1 - Probability of drawing a red ball = 1 - 2/5 = 3/5

e) Probability of drawing a red or white ball = Probability of drawing a red ball + Probability of drawing a white ball = 6/15 + 4/15 = 10/15 = 2/3






In context of Computer Oriented Statistical Techniques,
Two cards are drawn from a well-shuffled ordinary deck of 52 cards. Find the probability that
they are both aces if the first card is (a) replaced and (b) not replaced.

(a) If the first card is replaced, then the probability of drawing an ace on the first draw is 4/52 (since there are 4 aces in the deck), and the probability of drawing an ace on the second draw is also 4/52. Thus, the probability of drawing two aces is:

P(two aces) = (4/52) * (4/52) = 1/169

(b) If the first card is not replaced, then the probability of drawing an ace on the first draw is 4/52, and the probability of drawing an ace on the second draw, given that the first draw was an ace, is 3/51 (since there are now only 3 aces left in the deck and only 51 cards remaining). Thus, the probability of drawing two aces is:

P(two aces) = (4/52) * (3/51) = 1/221





In context of Computer Oriented Statistical Techniques,
Three cards are drawn from a deck of 52 cards. Find the probability that (a) two are jacks
and one is a king, (b) all cards are of one suit, (c) all cards are of different suits, and (d ) at least
two aces are drawn.

(a) Probability that two are jacks and one is a king:
There are 4 jacks and 4 kings in a deck of 52 cards. The probability of drawing a jack on the first draw is 4/52. After drawing a jack, there are 3 jacks left in the deck out of 51 cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing another jack is 3/51. For the third card, there are 4 kings left in the deck out of 50 cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing a king is 4/50. The probability of drawing two jacks and one king is:

P = (4/52) x (3/51) x (4/50) = 0.000181

(b) Probability that all cards are of one suit:
There are 4 suits in a deck of 52 cards, each containing 13 cards. The probability of drawing a card of a particular suit on the first draw is 13/52. After drawing a card of that suit, there are 12 cards of that suit left in the deck out of 51 cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing another card of that suit is 12/51. For the third card, there are 11 cards of that suit left in the deck out of 50 cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing a third card of that suit is 11/50. Since there are four suits, there are four ways to draw three cards of the same suit. Therefore, the probability of drawing three cards of the same suit is:

P = 4 x (13/52) x (12/51) x (11/50) = 0.002641

(c) Probability that all cards are of different suits:
There are 4 suits in a deck of 52 cards, each containing 13 cards. The probability of drawing a card of a particular suit on the first draw is 13/52. After drawing a card of that suit, there are 39 cards of other suits left in the deck out of 51 cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing a card of a different suit on the second draw is 39/51. For the third card, there are 38 cards of other suits left in the deck out of 50 cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing a card of a different suit on the third draw is 38/50. Since there are 4 suits, there are 4! = 24 ways to draw three cards of different suits. Therefore, the probability of drawing three cards of different suits is:

P = 24 x (13/52) x (39/51) x (38/50) = 0.352941

(d) Probability that at least two aces are drawn:
There are 4 aces in a deck of 52 cards. The probability of drawing an ace on the first draw is 4/52. After drawing an ace, there are 3 aces left in the deck out of 51 cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing another ace is 3/51. For the third card, there are 50 cards left in the deck, out of which 48 are not aces. Therefore, the probability of not drawing an ace is 48/50. The probability of drawing at least two aces is:

P = (4/52) x (3/51) x (48/50) + (4/52) x (48/51) x (3/50) + (48/52) x (4/51) x (3/50) + (4/52) x (3/51) x (2/50) = 0.058824

In context of Computer Oriented Statistical Techniques,
The masses of 72 ball bearings are normally distributed, with a mean of 22.40 g and a
standard deviation of 0.048 g. If 300 random samples of size 36 are drawn from this population,
determine the expected mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of means if the
sampling is done (a) with replacement and (b) without replacement.

Given:

Population Mean, μ = 22.40 g
Population Standard Deviation, σ = 0.048 g
Sample size, n = 36

(a) Sampling with replacement:
The expected mean of the sampling distribution of means is equal to the population mean.
Expected Mean of Sampling Distribution of Means = μ = 22.40 g

The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of means is given by the formula:
σx̅ = σ / sqrt(n)
where σx̅ is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of means.

Substituting the values, we get:
σx̅ = 0.048 / sqrt(36) = 0.008 g

Expected Standard Deviation of Sampling Distribution of Means = σx̅ = 0.008 g

(b) Sampling without replacement:
The expected mean of the sampling distribution of means is equal to the population mean.
Expected Mean of Sampling Distribution of Means = μ = 22.40 g

The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of means is given by the formula:
σx̅ = σ / sqrt(n) * sqrt(1 - n/N)
where N is the population size.

Substituting the values, we get:
N = 72 (as there are 72 ball bearings in the population)
σx̅ = 0.048 / sqrt(36) * sqrt(1 - 36/72) = 0.007 g

Expected Standard Deviation of Sampling Distribution of Means = σx̅ = 0.007 g
