Sure, here are the first four moments about the mean for the set of numbers 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17:

First moment about the mean (Mean Deviation):

The mean of the set is (2 + 5 + 8 + 11 + 14 + 17) / 6 = 9.5

The first moment about the mean is the sum of the deviations of each data point from the mean, divided by the total number of data points.

So, the first moment about the mean is:

(2 - 9.5) + (5 - 9.5) + (8 - 9.5) + (11 - 9.5) + (14 - 9.5) + (17 - 9.5) / 6

= (-7.5 + -4.5 + -1.5 + 1.5 + 4.5 + 7.5) / 6

= 0

Second moment about the mean (Variance):

The second moment about the mean is the average of the squared deviations from the mean. It gives an idea of how much the data is spread out.

So, the second moment about the mean is:

[ (2 - 9.5)^2 + (5 - 9.5)^2 + (8 - 9.5)^2 + (11 - 9.5)^2 + (14 - 9.5)^2 + (17 - 9.5)^2 ] / 6

= [ 54.5 + 21.5 + 2.25 + 2.25 + 21.5 + 54.5 ] / 6

= 28.75

Third moment about the mean (Skewness):

The third moment about the mean is a measure of the symmetry of the data. A positive value indicates that the tail of the distribution is longer on the right side than on the left side. A negative value indicates the opposite.

So, the third moment about the mean is:

[ (2 - 9.5)^3 + (5 - 9.5)^3 + (8 - 9.5)^3 + (11 - 9.5)^3 + (14 - 9.5)^3 + (17 - 9.5)^3 ] / [ 6 * (28.75)^(3/2) ]

= [ -304.5 + -91.125 + -5.0625 + 5.0625 + 91.125 + 304.5 ] / [ 6 * (28.75)^(3/2) ]

= 0

Fourth moment about the mean (Kurtosis):

The fourth moment about the mean is a measure of the peakedness of the distribution. A high value indicates a sharper peak and heavier tails. A low value indicates a flatter peak and lighter tails.

So, the fourth moment about the mean is:

[ (2 - 9.5)^4 + (5 - 9.5)^4 + (8 - 9.5)^4 + (11 - 9.5)^4 + (14 - 9.5)^4 + (17 - 9.5)^4 ] / [ 6 * (28.75)^(2) ]

= [ 17119.8125 + 1163.859375 + 15.06640625 + 15.06640625 + 1163.859375 + 17119.8125 ] / [ 6 * (28.75)^(2) ]

= 2.272
