In context of Computer Oriented Statistical Techniques,
Find coefficient of kurtosis of the set of the numbers: 2, 3, 7, 8, 10

To find the coefficient of kurtosis of the given set of numbers, we first need to calculate the fourth moment about the mean and the variance of the data.

The mean of the given data is:

Mean (μ) = (2 + 3 + 7 + 8 + 10)/5 = 30/5 = 6

The variance of the given data is:

σ² = [(2-6)² + (3-6)² + (7-6)² + (8-6)² + (10-6)²]/5

σ² = [16 + 9 + 1 + 4 + 16]/5

σ² = 46/5

σ² = 9.2

Now, we need to calculate the fourth moment about the mean, which is given by the formula:

m₄ = [∑(Xᵢ-μ)⁴]/n

where Xᵢ represents the ith data value, μ represents the mean of the data, and n represents the sample size.

Substituting the values, we get:

m₄ = [(2-6)⁴ + (3-6)⁴ + (7-6)⁴ + (8-6)⁴ + (10-6)⁴]/5

m₄ = [16 + 81 + 1 + 4 + 256]/5

m₄ = 358/5

m₄ = 71.6

Now, we can calculate the coefficient of kurtosis using the formula:

Kurtosis = [m₄/(σ²)²] - 3

Substituting the values, we get:

Kurtosis = [71.6/(9.2)²] - 3

Kurtosis = [71.6/84.64] - 3

Kurtosis = 0.846 - 3

Kurtosis = -2.154

Therefore, the coefficient of kurtosis of the given set of numbers is -2.154. Since the kurtosis is less than 3, it indicates that the distribution is platykurtic, which means it is flatter and more dispersed than the normal distribution.
