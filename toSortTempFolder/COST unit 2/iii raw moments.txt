The raw moments of a set of numbers are calculated by raising each value to a power and then taking the arithmetic mean of those values.

The formula for the kth raw moment is:

M_k = (1/n) * Î£(xi^k)

where n is the number of values in the set, xi is the ith value in the set, and k is the order of the moment.

For the set of numbers: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17

The first raw moment (k=1) is simply the arithmetic mean of the values:

M_1 = (2+5+8+11+14+17)/6 = 9.5

The second raw moment (k=2) is calculated as:

M_2 = (1/6) * [(2^2)+(5^2)+(8^2)+(11^2)+(14^2)+(17^2)] = 119.1667

The third raw moment (k=3) is calculated as:

M_3 = (1/6) * [(2^3)+(5^3)+(8^3)+(11^3)+(14^3)+(17^3)] = 1875.5

The fourth raw moment (k=4) is calculated as:

M_4 = (1/6) * [(2^4)+(5^4)+(8^4)+(11^4)+(14^4)+(17^4)] = 36339.6667

Therefore, the first four raw moments for the set of numbers 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17 are:

M_1 = 9.5
M_2 = 119.1667
M_3 = 1875.5
M_4 = 36339.6667
